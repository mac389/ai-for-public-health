# Course Description 

The digitization of health care, syndromic surveillance, and movements such as ''quantified self'' have created a massive ammount of biomedical data. Some of these data could become useful information, but the pace of accumulation of these data outstrips the processing ability of humans. One scalable solution is to build a computational representation of human reasoning. This course introduces ontologies, one method to unambiguously represent parts of human reasoning. We introduce ontologies through the [CDC's Proposal to Integrate Reporting Adverse Events from Multiple Sources](https://www.cdc.gov/ophss/chiic/projects/2015/ideas/exploration-of-ontological-management-of-reportable-events-to-facilitate-surveillance.html).

This course is intended for clinicians who want to become familiar with ontologies as a means to explicitly represent biomedical knowledge and embed that knowledge in applications that automatically process data. It is also appropriate for researchers with no prior background in knowledge representation. 

# Course Objective 

By the end of the course, participants will be able to:

1. Understand [Basic Formal Ontology, Link is to YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9bA0_BobTQ)
1. Become familiar with [Protege](https://protege.stanford.edu/) and [WebVOWL](http://vowl.visualdataweb.org/webvowl.html) creating an ontology
1. Create a small ontolgy in the participant's domain of interest

# Prerequisites

Participants should bring their own laptops.

# Instructor 
### Michael Chary, MD, PhD

Michael Chary received his MD and PhD (computational neuroscience, electrophysiology) from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. He completed residency training in Emergency Medicine at NewYork Presbyterian\Queens. He is now a Fellow at the Harvard Medical Toxicology Fellowship. 

Michael uses computational linguistics and applied mathematics to analyze social media for public health research and drug discovery. His group, ToxTweet, was the first to demonstrate that the geographic distribution of recreational drug use could be accurately estimated from Twitter and the dosage, signs and symptoms of opioid overdose inferred from YouTube comments. This is the course's first year.
